how to deal with pull requests for the main branch instead of the dev branch
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9135913/merge-pull-request-to-a-different-branch-than-default-in-github
- git fetch origin pull/ID/head:BRANCHNAME



- think about the expression decomposition static asserts
- the static assert should use the c++11 feature if possible

- write a test in a header in one binary with multiple cpp files
- coverage
- better docs
    - updated compile time benchmarks (and include linux!)
    - list the subcases as a major selling point on the main page - after the expression decomposition macro stuff
    - faq - why macros - http://accu.org/index.php/journals/2064
    - FAQ - how is it different from Catch (or what is lacking)
    - faq - why c++
    - post the traffic screenshot in the FAQ - "how epic was the initial release"
